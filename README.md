<h1> Active Directory Lab </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved setting up and configuring an Active Directory environment to simulate enterprise-level access control and user management. A new domain, Montigny.com, was created and fully configured, including DNS verification. An organizational unit (OU) named CYB-515 was established, into which ten users were added using both command-line tools and PowerShell scripting. Five security groups were also created to structure user access. Default password policies were reviewed, then updated to enforce stronger security, and applied using gpupdate /force. This lab emphasized secure design principles such as least privilege, role-based access control, and policy enforcementâ€”foundational elements in maintaining organizational security and infrastructure integrity.
